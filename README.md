# Mordecai's Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website. It makes use of Hugo as the static site generator and the [Blowfish theme](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish). This employs some automation through the use of GitHub Actions. 

The GitHub Action updates the `gh-pages` branch when new changes are pushed to `main` branch, afterwhich GitHub Pages sources and deploys from the `gh-pages` branch.
