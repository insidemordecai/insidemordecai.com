On my quest to constantly learn and upskill, I have taken on multiple projects, here are some of my works:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Logo</th>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Link(s)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td><img class="customEntitityAlbum" src="img/etransact-text-logo.png"/></td>
            <td>eTransact</td>
            <td>A mobile app and a companion web app built on Flutter for vendors to send transactional documents (invoices...) and customers to receive them. It makes use of Firebase for the authentication and storage. </td>
            <td><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/insidemordecai/etransact/">GitHub</a></td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><img class="customEntitityAlbum" src="img/cz-logo.png"/></td>
            <td>Chequered Zone</td>
            <td>A fullstack motorsport news website with users and their priviledges - standard users and admins. This was built using PHP and CSS (Bootstrap) with the backend as MySQL</td>
            <td><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/insidemordecai/chequered-zone/">GitHub</a></td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><img class="customEntitityAlbum" src="img/tbm-logo.png"/></td>
            <td>Think Big Marketing</td>
            <td>A simple website to showcase a marketing firm with some blog entries. This was built with just HTML and vanilla CSS</td>
