On my quest to constantly learn and upskill, I have taken on multiple projects, here are some of my works:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Logo</th>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Link</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td><img class="customEntitityAlbum" src="etransact-text-logo.png"/></td>
            <td>eTransact</td>
            <td>A mobile app and a companion web app built on Flutter for vendors to send transactional documents (invoices...) and customers to receive them. It makes use of Firebase for the authentication and storage. </td>
            <td><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/insidemordecai/etransact/">GitHub</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
