Some of you might have noticed that I'm gradually shifting the tone and style of my writings on this blog. I'm moving away from more technical articles to focus on personal opinion pieces. While still centred around tech, these posts will lean less on 'how-to' and more on 'here's why.'

I may include a few technical articles occasionally but not too often. Additionally, I might explore other topics of interest.

I don't want to box myself into a small corner, considering that my life has been anything but that. Looking at Manu Moreale's blog and 47nil among others, I've come to appreciate the freedom to write as little as a one-liner, a paragraph, or something longer, without feeling compelled to reach a certain length.
