Guess what? 
Email is not dead!
And this is yet another post about emails ðŸ˜¬

Of course email is not dead and might not die any time soon but it might as well be declared a relic of the past in regards to informal communication and thatâ€™s quite sad. 

I feel like it should not be used purely for work, newsletters, scams, receiving codes when we sign up for yet another account and such.

There is something interesting about communicating through a slow medium in the modern age (relative to instant messaging) that gets rid of the pressure to be constantly accessible 24/7 and encourages a more thoughtful message. 

Also, please donâ€™t make personal email formal with your â€˜Best Regardsâ€™, â€˜Sincerelyâ€™ and the many corporate alternatives out there. â€¨Donâ€™t bother with rules of capitalisation, play around ala Margo from John Green's _Paper Towns_.
Attach funky gif, rick-roll someone. 
Spice it up a bit, show some personality.

On a different note, I have recently reconnected with old friends via email.
Most of them find it odd but whatâ€™s a mere mortal got to do when someone changes their phone number for some reason or moves country and you lose touch. â€¨Email often is the only constant in this case.

We should use email more to connect with each other. 
To start it off, if you have anything you want to share with me, send me one. 
Ask me about my hometown or country, my experiences, previous topics Iâ€™ve written about, tech, music, reading, anything really.
Donâ€™t be shy, just write away. 

If you donâ€™t know where to get my details, hint hint, my [contact page]({{< ref "contact/index.md" >}}) has something ðŸ˜‚.
