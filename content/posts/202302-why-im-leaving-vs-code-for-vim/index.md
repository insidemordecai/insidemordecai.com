My journey with text editors has been one where I find one I like and I settle with that. I learnt programming around 2015 but nothing too serious, heck I used Notepad on Windows. By 2016, I got more into it, discovered Atom and immediately fell in love with it.

It was marketed towards the kind of person who would tinker with things to suite their needs. Superficially though, I also liked the default colour scheme Atom used - One Dark.

At this point VS Code had definitely gained some traction but I stuck with Atom. That was until I joined uni in 2018, some students did not have a clue about text editors and some had their preference. I noticed those who were more experienced than I was were using VS Code and I could no longer ignore it. I adopted it and it has been my preferred text editor. So what's changed?
