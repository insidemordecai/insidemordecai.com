On 7th October 2022, Elon Musk concluded his purchase of Twitter and it has been quite a journey since then. I won't bore you with the details but it ranges from introducing Twitter Blue, making API changes, limiting the number of tweets one can read in a day to recently rebranding Twitter as X. Reddit hasn't been much better but what can we do?

Let's take it to the past, the year is 2012 and my mother has a shiny new phone. This was the second fully touch screen device in the family so I was excited every time she would come back home. She made it clear I was not to join Facebook so I'd play games but the app was calling my name. Behind her back, I would join FB and revel at this new world all the while trying to be discreet. This did not last long but surprisingly I was not scolded. We had a talk of how I should use it and it was free reign from there.

Cue in a spree of joining every social media platform imaginable. My first Twitter account came in 2013 as well as many other accounts when I'd inadvertently create a new one. Shows like iCarly brought forth the bad habit of tweeting literally every minute. These accounts are still in the wild and to this day I get tagged in some of my old cringe posts.

Google+ came in the scene and I have to admit that was one of the best platforms alongside Twitter if not the best.

Blogging became a huge thing, Google had Blogger, there was Wordpress and I jumped right in. One thing I regret is deleting those blogs but I understand how cathartic that could have been. I have come to learn of the importance of having an archive where you can look back at your older work and perhaps delight in your improvement (or lack of) over time.

Twitter had a resurgence, I had a fallout with Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Dec 2019/Jan 2020 came and I deleted my account, creating new ones where necessary with a clear privacy stance in mind.

We get back to Elon taking over Twitter and soon other platforms come but this time I'm not too quick in joining them - cough cough Mastodon cough. This is until mid-2023 when Twitter's rate limit is implemented that I start looking for invites for BlueSky - Jack Dorsey's invite-only Twitter alternative. 

Meta capitalised on Twitter's issues by launching Threads and technically I already had an account because they were clever as you would just use your Instagram account. Everyone and their dog tried it out but soon it felt like it was launched prematurely. Don't get me wrong, it was great but it lacked a lot of features. Meta was not as aggressive as I expected in having feature-parity with Twitter.
