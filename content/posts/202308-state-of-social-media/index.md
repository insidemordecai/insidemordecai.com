On 7th October 2022, Elon Musk concluded his purchase of Twitter and it has been quite a journey since then. From introducing Twitter Blue, expensive API changes, daily limit on the number of tweets one can view to rebranding Twitter as X. Reddit has followed a similar script but what can we do?

Let's take it to the past, the year is 2012 and my mother has a shiny new phone and so I was excited every time she would come from work. She made it clear that I was not to join Facebook so I'd play games but the app was calling my name. Behind her back, I would join FB and revel at this new world all the while trying to be discreet. This did not last long but surprisingly I was not scolded. We had a talk of how I should use it and it was free reign from there.

Cue in a spree of joining every social media platform imaginable. It was love at first sight when in 2013, I created my first Twitter account. Shows like iCarly brought forth the bad habit of tweeting every minute and to this day I still get tagged in these old cringe tweets. 

Google+ came in the scene and I have to admit that was one of the best platforms alongside Twitter if not the best.

Blogging became a huge thing and I jumped right in. However, one thing I regret is deleting my old blogs. I understand how cathartic that could have been but I have come to learn of the importance of having an archive where you can look at your older work and perhaps delight in your improvement (or lack of) over time.

Facebook had the Cambridge Analytica scandal. December 2018/January 2019 came, I deleted most of my online accounts but created new ones where necessary with a clear privacy stance in mind.

We get back to Elon taking over Twitter and soon other alternative platforms like Mastodon rise but this time I'm not too quick in joining them. My eyes were on BlueSky - Jack Dorsey's invite-only Twitter alternative. 

Meta capitalised on Twitter's issues by launching Threads and technically every Instagram user already had an account. Everyone and their dog tried it out but to me it felt like it was launched prematurely. Don't get me wrong, it was great but it lacked a lot of features. Meta was not as aggressive as I expected in having feature parity with Twitter.

During the same week, I got an invite into BlueSky and it was amazing. It was everything I hoped for albeit the userbase was minuscule. It had and still has the vibe of Twitter from the early days.

Twitter, even with the rebranding, is still the juggernaut that brought 'microblogging' to the masses and it will take a lot for the alternatives to bring it down or Elon himself.

So what's the future? I don't know but juggling between Twitter and its alternatives as well as other platforms can be tiring. Ideally there would be interoperability between different platforms.  

This may come down to a battle of protocols but I, for one, hope personal websites make a comeback. A place that can be regarded your home base.
