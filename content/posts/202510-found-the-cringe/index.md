Perhaps the universe willed me on after writing [the previous article]({{< ref "posts/202509-save-the-cringe/index.md" >}}), or maybe it was just sheer luck.
After expressing my regret about deleting old pieces and media, I decided to dig through some things in storage, and what a surprise lay before me.
I found a few old novels and novellas I’d completely forgotten about, and even better, a couple of notebooks were mixed in there too.

All my early write-ups used to start on paper, and because of that, I now have access to some of my old poems, articles, and stories — some finished, others still in draft form.

I won’t lie, they’re a bit cringey as expected, but over the coming weeks and months I’ll figure out how to upload them here.
I’m not planning to actively promote them, but I’m genuinely excited to have recovered what feels like my lost archives.

Discovering them felt as if I’d stumbled upon a portable teleportation device.
In an instant I was pulled back: old habits, old friends, and familiar places flashing through my mind.
Each scribble, sketch up, sticky note, and all sorts of attachments in the notebooks carried a piece of who I used to be — a quiet reminder of how much of that version of me still lingers, and how much has changed.
