While relaxing with a freshly brewed cup of coffee in hand, I got this wave of inspiration. 
The thought was always around but I could never find a way to put it in writing.
This time I was enthralled in a flow state, the words were floating around, spilling onto my keyboard and within no time I was done with the draft of my [previous post]({{< ref "posts/202411-pronouns/index.md" >}}). 

I gave it a quick read and for the first time I knew I had to ask someone else to review my work. 

I don’t like having my creation “reviewed” or “approved” since after all, this is MY personal corner of the internet. 

The reason for this exception is I was dealing with a contentious topic and of course I didn’t want to offend anyone. 
You have tread delicately nowadays and walk on egg shells while handling certain topics. 
Additionally, you could put out something and have it haunt your future self. 
Is that the best way to live? 
I doubt that. 

I think the problem is we are living publicly either through social media or under the media’s watchful eye if somehow you are a celebrity reading my site. 
Previously you would stumble your way through your mistakes and come out the other end a better human without fear of some old tweet resurfacing.
Sadly, that’s no longer possible.

We should have more leeway since each one of us changes their ideologies and opinions throughout their life.
If you don’t then, you’re not growing or good on you for getting it right from the beginning.
