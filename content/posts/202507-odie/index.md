The loss of a dear pet is one of the hardest things to bear.
Iâ€™ve lost pets before, in different ways, but nothing truly prepares you for the slow, painful anticipation of a loss you see coming.

It all started when my guard dog, Odie, missed his rabies shot.
If only he could talk to remind us, nudge us.
I was oblivious, until a few nights back when the signs began to show.
The vet confirmed it, and more painfully still, thereâ€™s no choice but to watch him go, slowly.

Heâ€™s fighting a battle he canâ€™t win, and he seems to know it.
He isnâ€™t wild or restless but just lies there quietly waiting for dusk to come.
His exit will be gracious (if that word even fits), full of dignityâ€¦ but I still canâ€™t bring myself to accept it.
Maybe writing this down, setting it free, will help.

He may just be a guard dog, not a house pet curled up on the couch, but words canâ€™t quite hold his absence and the emptiness left behind.
I named him after the dog from my favourite childhood movie â€” Garfield.
The resemblance was there â€” he had the same look, the same naivety and even the cheerfulness.
Not to forget his little beef with my cats (little Garfields themselves).
He was the bully though ðŸ˜‚.

We expect him to guard the stars tonight but he is deeply missed.

Run free, little one.
