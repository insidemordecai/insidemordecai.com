I thought I‚Äôd post my Spotify Wrapped on this corner of the internet this year and not just on social media.

It‚Äôs not Christmas, but it‚Äôs that time of the year to unwrap our music taste, discover how basic it is and have our egos crushed.
Being a Wednesday, I expected Wrapped to drop any time soon but nothing came while I jealously watched Apple Music users share their Replay.
As I drove back home, I kept wondering, who would end up on my list alongside Adele? 

I have a list of albums to get to, be it to explore new artists or delve deeper into the discographies of some of my favourite musicians. 
Top on that was Pink Floyd‚Äôs _The Dark Side Of The Moon_ and Radiohead‚Äôs _In Rainbows_ and I managed to get to them.
Saying I love them is a massive understatement because I absolutely devoured those two albums, I was definitely expecting them to make an appearance. 
Lo and behold, they did not make it.

![My Spotify Wrapped 2024 summary with my top artists in this order: Beyonce, Adele, Billie Eilish, Doja Cat and James Blake. My top songs are Without You by TEEKS, Indigo Night by Tamino, Wanna Be by GloRilla with Megan Thee Stallion, BIRDS OF A FEATHER by Billie Eilish and Love In The Dark by Adele.](img/wrapped-2024-summary.jpeg "My Spotify Wrapped 2024 Summary")

I got home and my top two songs came as no surprise to me. 
I have a soft spot for ballads that I can learn from while stretching my vocal pipes ‚Äî no wonder Adele is my favourite artist.

TEEKS has mentioned before that he listens to Adele and the inspiration is clear on _Without You_.
He delivers an emotive performance with just the piano for accompaniment.
The background vocals join in and they are just so ethereal and velvety like embracing a cloud, the same could be said of Tamino‚Äôs Arabian touches.
I had never heard of Tamino before but _Indigo Night_ and _Habibi_ took over my life for some time. 
The writing, tender runs and other captivating vocal nuances have you in awe.

The simplicity in those songs make them stand out. 
I want to me close my eyes and get lost in their world as sounds envelope my ears. 

The other top songs are: 

3. GloRilla - Wanna Be (with Megan Thee Stallion)
4. Billie Eilish - BIRDS OF A FEATHER
5. Adele - Love In The Dark

I love Beyonc√© and, retrospectively, it makes sense she appeared on my list but I did not expect her to top it.
I was in disbelief until I realised she dropped _COWBOY CARTER_ this year and I finally gave _RENAISSANCE_ another go on top of my usual Beyonc√© rotations.
Clearly the data doesn‚Äôt lie, heck I was top 1% of her listeners.

Billie Eilish had quite an amazing year. 
_HIT ME HARD AND SOFT_ was a masterpiece in my books with great production from FINNEAS. 
We get glimpses of Billie‚Äôs emotions with poignantly rich lyrics exploring different topics from love, sexuality, weight and everything in between.
This is an album where something will deeply resonate with you. 

I don‚Äôt have much to say about Doja Cat besides she‚Äôs a talented well-rounded artist. 
[_Mooo!_](https://youtu.be/mXnJqYwebF8) is a satirical play on words and classic tunes while poking fun at the rap landscape of the time.
You could say the track was childish, but it was fun.
I still love it and that‚Äôs what got me onto her music back then. 

James! James! James!
My friends will probably tell you he‚Äôs the only artist I speak so much about besides the obvious one starting with an A.
He‚Äôs my favourite male vocalist and producer of recent years with his angelic voice.‚Ä®
I constantly revisit _Friends That Break Your Heart_ which was my first full album from him. 
It‚Äôs the easiest entry point into his rich catalogue that stretches all the way back to his experimental electronic origins. 

Perhaps this list wasn‚Äôt a surprise after all. 

My top genres would probably have been Pop, Rap, R&B, Rock and EDM, in that order, if Spotify had included them this year. 
That‚Äôs just one of the disappointing misses of Spotify Wrapped 2024.
Who would have guessed firing the entire office would be a detriment to them?

Anyway, what was on your Spotify Wrapped this year? And what would you definitively recommend I should listen to?

Sadly, I just have the playlists from before 2022 to 2018 and not any other data. 
I can only recall that Adele topped the list every year and there was an increase in minutes listened every consecutive year. 

With that, cheers ‚úåÔ∏è.
