Thank you for passing by. 

This is just a short introduction piece, much like how printing "Hello world" is usually the first thing one learns when they begin programming. So this is just what I intend to do with this website.

<!--more-->

I plan on this being more like a frankenstein of a blog and a portfolio - blogfolio, is that even a word? 🤷‍♂️ It will host articles on things I find interesting around tech including concept breakdowns, Linux and FOSS or how-tos just for my referral in the future and in the process benefit whoever stumbles upon this.

As this is a static site, currently a comment section is not implemented and I am not sure if I'll do so. I am weighing up the pros and cons of having it but we'll see how this goes. 

Anyway, feel free to reach out to me.

Cheers ✌️
