Years ago, I left comments on peopleâ€™s blogs which led to interesting discussions and even friendships.
I'd like to return to that habit because it encourages interactions, and learning.

A few months back, I responded to a post by [Niq](https://niqwithq.com/) via email and I found the interaction quite pleasant albeit short. 
He even shared with me extra details on my latest post at that point. 

Through this interaction, I realised the benefits of this feature on a website, which led me down a rabbit hole of old posts I read before from Niq and [Kev Quick](https://kevquirk.com/). 

Thatâ€™s when I noticed many independent blogs have a 'Reply by Email' option. 
I liked it due to its simplicity. 

So you might ask yourself, what is 'Reply by Email'? 
Itâ€™s simply a way to leave a comment but via email ðŸ˜‚

Email has been there for years and everyone has it so you donâ€™t need to create an account to leave a comment. 
It also minimises spam because few will put in the effort just to send irrelevant comments.
Additionally, email encourages fleshed-out responses unlike the quick 'nice read' comments typical on social media. 

I could go on but I recommend you read [Niqâ€™s](https://niqwithq.com/posts/reply-by-email) and [Kev Quirkâ€™s post](https://kevquirk.com/blog/online-conversations-website-engagement) on it.

With all that, I got to working, developed the feature for [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/), and itâ€™s now live on this website - feel free to give it a try.
