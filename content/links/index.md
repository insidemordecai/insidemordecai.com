Here is a collection of other blogs, podcasts and posts that I frequently reference or find interesting and inspirational and would wholeheartedly recommend.

## Blogroll

- [47nil](https://47nil.com) - The owner describes it as a personal blog about common sense where he dumps everything on his mind.  
- [A Very Good Blog](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/) - honest reflections, messy truths, and relatable reckonings. Case in point: [Fellas, is it gay to like pop music? (or: “Toxic”)](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/fellas-is-it-gay-to-like-pop-music/) which is one of my favourite pieces on the internet.
- [Christopher Butler](https://www.chrbutler.com/) - thoughts on evolution of design and culture.
- [Herman's Blog](https://herman.bearblog.dev/) - short-to-mid length essays about life, tech, and anything interesting.
- [Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/) - posts about tech, web design, watch collecting and Kev's other interests.
- [Kwon.nyc](https://kwon.nyc/) - an 'online journal' about things Rachel observes in her daily life, thoughts on them, and more.
- [Labnotes](https://labnotes.org/) - think of this as a witty and informative weekly compilation of links, images, posts and pretty much everything on tech, design, and culture.
- [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/) - Manuel writes about independent web, minimalism, tech, personal insights and a lot about people. You can discover some of them in his [People & Blogs](https://manuelmoreale.com/people-and-blogs) series. Also, his site has a tasteful and thoughtful minimal style.

- [Public Diary Records](https://iamrajab.blogspot.com/) - a friend's blog all about daring poetry and reflections.

## Podroll

- [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) - this is **my favourite podcast** and it's about 'true stories of the dark side of the internet.' Jack Rhysider is a wonderful storyteller and has a way of making cyber-crime, hacking and all that fun jazz beginner-friendly.
