Posting on here is great, but often times I get a bigger smile engaging with different people to discuss music, books, projects, get feedback and anything under the sun.  

You could try to reach me via social media but I have a complicated relationship with it. 
The easiest and most reliable way to get me is via email. 
After all, email is not dead, so open up your preferred app and email `mk [at] insidemordecai [dot] com`.

Also, if you use iMessage, you can ping me with the same email.

Physically, you'll often find me in Nakuru or Nairobi. 
If you're around, we can have a chat over coffee.

Reach out, I promise I don't bite.
