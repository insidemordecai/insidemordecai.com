Publishing content on here is great, but the real joy often times is in engaging and connecting with different people to discuss music, books, projects, feedback, a mutual topic of interest and anything under the sun.  

You could try to reach me via social media but I have a complicated relationship with it. The most reliable and easiest way to reach me is via email. Email is not dead and should be used more often for connecting. Therefore, that's you cue to reach out at [mk@insidemordecai.com](mailto:mk@insidemordecai.com) about anything.

Also, if youâ€™re in the Apple ecosystem, you can ping me on Apple Messages using the same email.

Physically, you'll often find me in Nakuru or Nairobi, though I tend to be all over. If you're around, we can have a chat over coffee.

Reach out, I don't bite.
