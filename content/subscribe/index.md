RSS rocks and I absolutely love it! 
You can subscribe to this website using [RSS.](/index.xml) 

Copy this link into your RSS reader: 

```txt
https://insidemordecai.com/index.xml
```

For the uninitiated, check out [About Feeds (webpage)](https://aboutfeeds.com/) or [RSS Made Easy (video)](https://youtu.be/6HNUqDL-pI8) to learn more about RSS.
Thank me later!

I recommend either of these:
- [Unread](https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/) - what I currently use. Core features available for free (iOS/Mac). 
- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) - free and open source (iOS/Mac).
- [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) - allows 150 subscriptions on the free plan (iOS/Android/Web).

Need a hand? Donâ€™t hesitate to [reach out]({{< ref "contact/index.md" >}}) â€” Iâ€™ll show you the light! ðŸ˜‚
