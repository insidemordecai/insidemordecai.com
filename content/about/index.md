Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Business Advisor at [Odoo](https://odoo.com), a freelance Software Developer and a Computer Science graduate.

## What I do

I'm based in Kenya and as a Business Advisor, I work with clients across Africa helping them to understand and implement our software. Odoo is a Belgian software company that aims to streamline business through software, you can learn more at [odoo.com](https://odoo.com)

I have also been shipping code for just over half a decade. I mainly work with Front-End web projects but ocassionally dabble in some Fullstack development.

Previously I have worked in IT Support performing some network configuration and administration, system administration and maintenance tasks on top of solving day-to-day issues.

## Outside of Work

I obsessively watch motorsport - mainly Formula 1 (and its feeder series) and run a car/motorsport blog [found here][drivetalks].

I also read books when I can, you can have a look at my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/insidemordecai/).

In my former years, I did some piano playing and singing - not that I don't sing now but just to the audience of my pet.

## This Site 

My blog/portfolio has gone through a couple of changes throughout the years. Initially, I made it with WordPress, then good ol' HTML, Blogger and Medium. Later, I started to use a couple of templates and making tweaks to suite my style. Currently, this site is built using [Hugo][hugo] static site generator and [Blowfish][blowfish].
