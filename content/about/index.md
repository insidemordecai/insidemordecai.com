Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm a STEM Instructor, a freelance Software Developer and a Computer Science graduate based in Kenya. 
I write code, teach tech, build things, and learn as I go.
I've shared more about my work and background over on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/insidemordecai) if you're into that kind of thing.

Outside of work, I obsessively watch motorsport -- mainly Formula 1 and its feeder series -- and run a [car/motorsport blog](https://auto.insidemordecai.com/) when I remember.

I also read a lot, you can check out what I've been flipping through on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/insidemordecai/).

In my former years, I did some piano playing and singing. 
These days, the singing's still there but just to a much smaller (and furrier) audience.
