Hi 👋 I'm a STEM Instructor, a freelance Software Developer and a Computer Science graduate based in Kenya. 
I write code, teach tech, build things, and learn as I go.

I've shared more about my professional life over on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/insidemordecai) if you're keen on that.

Outside of work, I obsessively watch motorsport -- mainly Formula 1 and its feeder series -- and run a [car/motorsport blog](https://auto.insidemordecai.com/) when I remember.

I also read a lot, you can check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/insidemordecai/) to see what I've been flipping through.

In my former years, I did some piano playing and singing. 
These days, the singing's still there but just to a much smaller (and furrier) audience.
