Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Software Developer and a Computer Science graduate based in Kenya.

## What I do

For over half a decade, I have been shipping code to meet client needs but also for fun. I mainly work with frontend projects but ocassionally dabble in some fullstack development.

Previously, I worked with businesses across the continent as a Business Advisor helping them to understand and implement Odoo ERP. Odoo is a Belgian software company that aims to streamline businesses through software.

I have also worked in IT Support performing system and network administration and maintenance tasks on top of solving day-to-day issues.

## Outside of Work

I obsessively watch motorsport - mainly Formula 1 (and its feeder series) and run a car/motorsport blog [found here][drivetalks] that I haven't updated in a while.

I also read books quite a bit, you can have a look at my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/insidemordecai/).

In my former years, I did some piano playing and singing - not that I don't sing now but just to the audience of my pet.
