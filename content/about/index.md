Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mordecai, a Software Developer and a Computer Science graduate.

## What I do 

I'm based in Kenya and I have been shipping code for just over half a decade. I mainly work with front-end web projects but ocassionally dabble in some fullstack development. 

In 2019, I learnt Dart and consequently started using Flutter in mobile app projects.

Previously I have worked in an IT Support role performing some networking, system administration and maintenance tasks on top  of solving the day-to-day issues.

## Outside of tech

Outside of tech, I obsessively watch motorsport - mainly Formula 1 (and its feeder series). I also run a car/motorsport blog called [Drive Talks](https://drivetalks.car.blog)

In my former years, I did some piano playing and singing - not that I don't sing now but just to the audience of my pet.
