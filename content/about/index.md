Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Software Developer and a Computer Science graduate.

## What I do

I'm based in Kenya and I have been shipping code for just over half a decade. I mainly work with Front-End web projects but ocassionally dabble in some Fullstack development.

Previously I have worked in an IT Support role performing some networking configuration and administration, system administration and maintenance tasks on top of solving the day-to-day issues.

## Outside of Tech

Outside of tech, I obsessively watch motorsport - mainly Formula 1 (and its feeder series). I also run a car/motorsport blog [found here][drivetalks]

In my former years, I did some piano playing and singing - not that I don't sing now but just to the audience of my pet.

## This Site 

My blog/portfolio has gone through a couple of changes throughout the years. Initially, I made it with good ol' HTML, tried WordPress, Blogger and Medium. Later, I started to use a couple of templates and making tweaks to suite my style. Currently, this site is built using [Hugo][hugo] static site generator and [Blowfish][blowfish].
