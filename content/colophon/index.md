Currently, this site is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and [Blowfish theme](https://blowfish.page/) by [Nuno Cora√ß√£o](https://n9o.xyz/).

## Privacy 

This site makes use of [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) which is an open-source and privacy-friendly web analytics platform to view basic analytics. 

Additionally, Cloudflare logs some analytics but I can assure you, I don't do anything with this data or even check it on most occasions.

Finally, this is not a billboard and as such no ads are in place.
