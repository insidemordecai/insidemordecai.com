## Credits 

The various sites I've had over the years have gone through multiple iterations. From the days of Blogger, Wordpress, Medium, good ol' HTML and many more changes in between. 

Currently, this site is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and [Blowfish theme](https://blowfish.page/) by [Nuno Coração.](https://n9o.xyz/) 

## Privacy 

This site makes use of [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) which is an open-source and privacy-friendly web analytics platform to view basic analytics. 

Additionally, Cloudflare logs some analytics since I use [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and use it for DNS management.

No cookies or ads are in place - this is not a billboard.
